### Thanks for stopping by!

#### LLM stuff
I'm currently exploring LLM technologies in my [LLM repo](https://github.com/RobertHolderIII/LLM).  Anything that becomes particularly neat, I'll elevate to a top-level repo.

#### Crytography stuff
Imagine processing data without having to decrypt it! Think machine learning without the privacy concerns.  I spent four years exploring PETs, including homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation (SMPC).  I have a couple toys in the works....

#### Math stuff
What else?  I do online math help via the [Math Help group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mathhelp) on Facebook.  Some interesting problems become inspriation for Jupyter [notebooks](https://github.com/RobertHolderIII/mathhelp/tree/master/notebooks).  One fun problem was [helping to create a Christmas tree decor](https://github.com/RobertHolderIII/mathhelp/blob/master/notebooks/xmas.ipynb)!
